Hi Milan,

Congratulations on your Partner role at Deloitte! Your supply chain expertise is impressive.

We recently helped Home Credit optimize their coffee machine operations data, achieving 70% reduction in manual reporting across their office facilities. Our platform automated their coffee consumption analytics and predictive maintenance scheduling.

Given Deloitte's focus on operational efficiency, I believe we could help you implement similar coffee machine analytics and reporting solutions for your facilities management.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call to explore coffee machine data optimization?

Best regards,"""

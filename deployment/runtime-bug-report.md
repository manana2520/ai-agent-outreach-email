# Runtime Bug Report

## Issue: Missing Module in Runtime Image

**Runtime Image:** `manano2520/agentic-runtime:dev`

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.ai_agent_platform.runtime.common'`

**Location:** `/app/src/ai_agent_platform/runtime/api/routes/agents.py`, line 11

**Impact:** Agent pods crash and restart continuously, preventing agent deployment

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Deploy agent via Management API to local Kubernetes cluster
2. Agent pod starts and begins dependency installation
3. After dependencies are installed, runtime fails to start due to missing module
4. Pod crashes and restarts in a loop

## Expected Behavior

Runtime should start successfully and agent should be ready to accept connections.

## Current Status

- Agent deployment via API works correctly (instant deployment)
- Pod creation and dependency installation works
- Runtime startup fails due to missing module
- This is blocking local development and testing

## Recommendation

1. Fix the missing module in the runtime image
2. Test the runtime image before releasing
3. Consider using a stable tag instead of `:dev` for production deployments

## Environment

- Kubernetes: v1.25.16+k3s4 (Rancher Desktop)
- Namespace: ai-agent-platform
- Agent: sales-personalized-email-agent
